Follow these steps to set up and run the installation:

## Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/codeboylal/jenkins-docker-and-docker-compose-installation-script.git
```

## Navigate to the Script Directory

```
cd jenkins-docker-and-docker-compose-installation-script
```

## Make the Script Executable

```
chmod +x jenkins-docker-and-docker-compose-installation-script.sh
```

## Run the Installation Script

```
./jenkins-docker-and-docker-compose-installation-script.sh
```

This will start the installation process and configure docker, docker-compose and jenkins and also adds jenkins and user to the docker group. 
So, just run the script and chill!

Happy installing!
